### Kevin Sullivan writings on the foundations and practice of programming.

Welcome to CS1, Fall 2015! You are about to learn how to solve interesting and important problems in highly creative ways by developing and evolving software and software-based systems. I am writing a book for your use, which is contained right here in this repository! Moreover, I am developing it using the same tools and techniques that world-class software designers everywhere use to develop and evolve computing programs. In particular, I am using the so-called git distributed version control system, and the cloud-based GitHub service. I will be further developing and changing the book as we go. Accompanying the book are many example programs. You will be able easily to run (and change!) every program that you read about in the book. To use thi book and the associated materials, just clone this repository. I will be posting updates to this book on GitHub throughout the term. GitHub is a commercial "cloud-based" service for hosting git repositories such as this one." To obtain the latest updates from GitHub, just issue a "git pull" command in your shell from within the directory where this very file lives.
